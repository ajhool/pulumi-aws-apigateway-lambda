# Suggestions

1. Ability to test the component without building the multi-lang
2. Clear labeling for what files I should be touching
3. Single command multi-lang build & deploy
4. Schema for Resource Arguments
5. eslint was failing in VSCode, although deployments worked
6. cmd/pulumi-resource-awslambdaapi can have invalid typescript but the build proceeds.
7. Builds stopped propagating through and I didn't realize it for a while. Occurred when troubleshooting the ScheduleExpression
